# PokeSavRBG

PokeSavRBG is a save editor for the first generation Pokemon games.
Currently it works only with the german versions of the games, to make it work with the english versions the offsets would have to be changed.
It also computes the checksum the game checks before loading saves, which was reverse engineered using [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/)
